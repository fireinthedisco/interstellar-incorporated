#Bug fixed where army transports show up with the freighter ship model
#Localisation added for civilian armament policy
#Localisation added for different ship sizes
#Ships should now spawn correctly as different sizes (amount of cargo) and tanker/freighter/mixed models
#Civilian ship pirate suppression now entirely driven by suppression on the different ship types themselves (with different levels of armament), not by modifier applied by your policy
#Planet stockpiles should hopefully be working - but everyone just sends their goods on to the capital, at which point it's added into the empire stockpile. Planets don't receive shipments back to address their deficits yet
#Calculating planet orbital resources and removal of mining station and starbase resources and adding to their stockpiles moved into effects
