#Added full list of reactors/thrusters for IICSO ships so those components should now actually upgrade on civilian ships as your tech increases (could do some weird things with ships in games in progress, since I changed the names of the two components which had already been in)
#Added blockade bombardment stance - currently AI won't use it, though. Might want to do something where it's more likely to be used in trade conflicts, for example
#Freighters don't spawn if their solar system is occupied
#Freighters now check if their target planet is being bombarded/occupied for it to be valid
#Freighters now also check for the closest valid colony every time they enter a new system, and redirect there if it's different from current destination
#Freighters now get named according to the most populous resource they're filled with - rudimentary indication of fleet cargo
#Added edict to choose if you're hostile to all civilians, enemy civilians, or no civilians
#Added associated on actions - on war start, on war end, for setting hostility for those with policy hostile to enemy civilians
#Unawakened fallen empires no longer spawn autonomous miner ships
#Miners also don't spawn if there's a hostile fleet in the system
#Tweaked civilian ship computer - they now won't flee eternally into the void of space (trapping the attacking fleet in combat), they retreat to a distance and then hold their range. I want to find a way to just make them emergency FTL as soon as possible, even if not taking damage.
